# Example environment variables for local development
# WARNING: Embedding your Gemini API key into client-side code will expose it to end users.
# For prototypes you can use this, but for production use a server-side proxy to keep keys secret.

# Vite exposes env vars to the client only if they begin with VITE_
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyANkexm3YCqVo-vQ_Gms-ZsairtnuzTCeM

# For a safer deployment, do NOT set a client-side key; instead create serverless endpoints
# and set a server-only secret named GEMINI_API_KEY in your hosting platform.
